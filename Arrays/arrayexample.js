//*Example*//
//To make an array we create a list by using [square brackets] and "," commas//
let films = ["Blade Runner","Blues Brothers","Lord of the Rings","Matrix","2001 A Space Odyssey","the Shining","Full Metal Jacket","Batman the Dark Night","Romeo+Juliet","Star Wars"] 
console.log(films);
//In order to select a string on this list like my third favourite film on this list I make a "[2]" in order to select the third one because js starts at 0//
console.log("My third favourite film is " +films[2]);
//In order to count how many things are in our array we use "+ example.length +" in order to crate a count.
console.log("I have " + films.length + " favourite films.");
//
